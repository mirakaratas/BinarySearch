Binary Search Trees
fr

This is the repository for the Binary Search Trees project built for the Odin Project.

The project consits of an an implementation of the binary search tree data structure written in JavaScript.

The goal of the project was to solidify key fundamental computer science concepts such as data structures, algorithms and recursion.

Technologies Used
JavaScript
Methods of the data structure
insert(value) - inserts a new node with the given value into the tree
remove(value) - removes the node holding the given value from the tree
find(value) - returns the node holding the given value in the tree
levelOrder() - traverses each node of the tree in level order
inorder() - traverses each node of the tree inorder
preorder() - traverses each node of the tree preorder
postorder() - traverses each node of the tree postorder
height() - returns the height of a node -- defined as the longest path between the node and a leaf node
depth() - returns the depth of a node -- defined as the distance between the node and the root
